-rw-r--r--    1 0        0           33143 Oct 29  2019 cute-alien.jpg
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0           34842 Oct 29  2019 cutie.png



To-agentJ.txt == All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.


if you string cutie.png you will see there is a hidden zip file like : To_agentR.txt

binwalk -e cutie.png --> _cutie.png.extracted

if you zip2john the file named 8702.zip and crack the hash:

alien

After that 7z 8072.zip and enter pass. Than you will see that the size of text file has changed.

content: We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

If you decode this you will find = Area51

steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg --> other username is james and password is hackerrules!
